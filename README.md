# VSD_Physical-Design-Openlane-SKY130
This is about a 5 day Workshop conducted by VLSI System Design on SOC Design/ Physical Design using Open-Source tools. The entire workflow was carried out in OpenLANE,  an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components . The PDK's used here is SKYWATER 130nm, which is an open source Process Design Kit.
